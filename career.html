    McDonald's Corporation and McDonald’s USA, LLC (“McDonald’s”) are committed to a policy of Equal Employment Opportunity and will not discriminate against an applicant or employee on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, citizenship status, age, disability, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, genetic information, or any other legally-recognized protected basis under federal, state or local laws, regulations or ordinances. Applicants with disabilities may be entitled to reasonable accommodation under the terms of the Americans with Disabilities Act and certain state or local laws. A reasonable accommodation is a change or adjustment to a job or work environment that will ensure an equal employment opportunity without imposing an undue hardship on the operation of the business. For corporately owned restaurant locations, please contact restaurantjobs.support@us.mcd.com if you need assistance completing any forms or to otherwise participate in the application process.
    
    Independent franchisees are Equal Opportunity employers committed to diverse and inclusive workforces. Franchisees are independent business people and not employed by McDonald’s. Thus, each franchisee and each franchisee restaurant is unique and the franchisee is alone responsible for all employment matters in their restaurant, including the terms and conditions of employment for their employees, such as hiring, firing, discipline, supervision, staffing and scheduling. The benefits described or referenced here are available at McDonald’s-owned restaurants and the restaurants of participating franchisees. Depending on the restaurant location you select, the job for which you apply may be in a restaurant owned and operated by an independent franchisee, and not with McDonald’s. This means the franchisee, not McDonald’s, is responsible for all employment matters at the restaurant. If you are hired for the job, the franchisee will be your employer, not McDonald’s. For franchisee restaurant locations, please contact the franchisee organization directly to the extent you need assistance in completing forms or otherwise participating in that franchisee’s application process.
